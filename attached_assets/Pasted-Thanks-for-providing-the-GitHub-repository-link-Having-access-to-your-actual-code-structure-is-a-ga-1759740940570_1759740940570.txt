Thanks for providing the GitHub repository link. Having access to your actual code structure is a game-changer for debugging.

After reviewing the repo, the issue is that your main **`admin/index.html`** file, which controls the CMS page, is missing the necessary **Identity script** and **CMS script** to function. Your current setup only includes them in the main website's `index.html`, but the CMS needs them in its specific admin file.

Here is the step-by-step fix to get the login modal to appear:

-----

## 1\. Update the `client/public/admin/index.html`

The file that loads the CMS is located at `client/public/admin/index.html`. It currently loads the main website styles and scripts, but not the CMS logic itself.

Open that file and ensure it has **four crucial scripts** just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CMS Admin</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
    
    <script>
        if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
            window.netlifyIdentity.on('init', user => {
                if (!user) {
                    // This forces the modal to open on the admin page if the user isn't logged in
                    window.netlifyIdentity.open(); 
                }
            });
        }
    </script>
    
</body>
</html>
```

### ‚ùì Why this solves the issue:

1.  The screen darkens because the browser sees a button that should be handled by a script, but the **`netlify-identity-widget.js`** script isn't loaded on that page, so the modal doesn't appear.
2.  The **`netlify-cms.js`** script is required to actually read your `config.yml` and render the admin UI.

-----

## 2\. Verify `config.yml` Location

You confirmed your `config.yml` is in the correct place, which is inside the admin folder:

  * `client/public/admin/config.yml`

This is correct. The `netlify-cms.js` script will automatically find this file and use it once it loads.

-----

## Final Action

1.  **Update** the content of your `client/public/admin/index.html` file with the essential scripts listed above.
2.  **Commit** and **Push** the changes to GitHub.
3.  After Netlify redeploys, try accessing the `/admin` page again.

The combination of the correct scripts and the correct file path will ensure the Identity widget loads and the login modal appears.
